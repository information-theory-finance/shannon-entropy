Shannon entropy quantifies the average uncertainty of a random variable.
Applied to financial return distributions, it captures the shape of uncertainty
in ways that variance alone cannot — distinguishing between distributions that
share the same second moment but differ in tail behaviour and regime structure.

   New here? Start with :ref:`overview` for context, then :ref:`theory` for
   the mathematics, and :ref:`finance` to see it applied to NSE data.
