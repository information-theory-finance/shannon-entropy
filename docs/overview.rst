Overview
========

Shannon entropy, introduced by Claude Shannon in 1948, is the foundational
measure of information theory. It quantifies the average number of bits
required to encode the outcome of a random variable — or equivalently, the
average uncertainty before observing an outcome.

----

Why Shannon Entropy
-------------------

Variance measures the spread of a distribution around its mean, but it is
sensitive only to the second moment. Two distributions — one Gaussian and one
with heavy tails — can share identical variance while carrying very different
information content. Entropy is sensitive to the full shape of the distribution:
its tails, its modes, and its asymmetry.

In financial time series, this distinction is practically significant. Asset
returns are not Gaussian. Entropy provides a model-free measure of uncertainty
that makes no distributional assumption.

Core Formula
------------

.. math::

   H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} p(x_i) \, \log_2 \, p(x_i)

where :math:`p(x_i)` is the probability of outcome :math:`x_i` and the sum
runs over all outcomes with positive probability. The unit is **bits** when
using base-2 logarithm.
